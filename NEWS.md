* Changed the structure of the package. 
* Applied the `log-sum-exp` trick for numerical stability.
* `rbary23L()` added for simple free-support Wasserstein barycenter computation.
* Two ad hoc median routines for images and histograms are removed.

# T4transport 0.1.2

* `gaussmed1d()` and `gaussmedpd()` now fully respects the product manifold perspective.
* `gwdist()` added for Sliced-Wasserstein distance computation.
