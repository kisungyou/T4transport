Description: Transport theory has seen much success in many fields of statistics and machine learning. We provide a variety of algorithms to compute Wasserstein distance, barycenter, and others. See Peyré and Cuturi (2019) <doi:10.1561/2200000073> for the general exposition to the study of computational optimal transport.
